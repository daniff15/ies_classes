# Review Questions
## A
There are three built-in life cycles:
- clean: to clean the project and remove all files generated by the previous build, also Maven invokes the clean lifecycle consisting of the following phases:

    -> pre-clean;

    -> clean;

    -> post-clean;
- default: the main life cycle as it's responsible for project deployment
    Main phases of the default lifecycle:

    -> validate: validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available;

    -> compile: compile the source code of the project;

    -> test: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework;

    -> package: take the compiled code and create the JAR file;

    -> integration-test: process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be runned;

    -> verify: run any checks to verify if the package is valid;

    -> install: install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally;

    -> deploy: done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects;
- site: Maven Site plugin is generally used to create fresh documentation to create reports, deploy site, etc. It has the following phases:

    -> pre-site;

    -> site;

    -> post-site;

    -> site-deploy;

Maven goals represent a specific task that contributes to the building and managing of a project. So yes, is appropriate to run our project.
Maven can also acctivate differente plugins, including plugins to execute specific class (goals)

A build phase is made up of a set of goals. Maven goals represent a specific task that contributes to the building and managing of a project.
Sometimes, a maven goal is not bound to a build phase. We can execute these goals through the command line like:
```bash
mvn plugin-prefix:goal

mvn plugin-group-id:plugin-artifact-id[:plugin-version]:goal
```
