## A
There are three built-in life cycles:
- clean: to clean the project and remove all files generated by the previous build, also Maven invokes the clean lifecycle consisting of the following phases:
    . pre-clean
    . clean
    . post-clean
- default: the main life cycle as it's responsible for project deployment
    Main phases of the default lifecycle:
    . validate: validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
    . compile: compile the source code of the project
    . test: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework.
    . package: take the compiled code and create the JAR file.
    . integration-test: process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be runned
    . verify: run any checks to verify if the package is valid
    . install: install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
    . deploy: done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
- site: Maven Site plugin is generally used to create fresh documentation to create reports, deploy site, etc. It has the following phases:
    . pre-site
    . site
    . post-site
    . site-deploy
